It is 4083 A.D. you have just finished your post doctorate fellowship in

Astrodynamical and Cosmic Systems Analysis. Now you are starting out your

career in the United Federation of Galactic Empires and have been assigned

to the highly prestigious Anomaly Control Agency (ACA). You have worked with

your fair share of anomalies in many different sectors of the galaxy

during graduate work missions, but the task you were handed today was like

nothing you've ever seen before. You look down at your screen to double

check the assignment orders.
