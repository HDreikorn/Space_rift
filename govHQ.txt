With it's fairly relaxed attitude this HQ is slow at getting things done,
but at least the view is nice and the waiting area feels like a resort.
After what feels like an hour, a man in a perfectly tailored suit addresses
you, "Dr. Castellano, sorry to keep you waiting. I'm Fredrique Gaul-- the
head of planetary affairs here. Let's go into my office I'll brief you over
some tea and snack. I presume you haven't had quality land food for at least
a few days... [Follow Fredrique to get briefing?]"
