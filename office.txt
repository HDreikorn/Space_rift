Sipping his earl grey tea, Fredrique begins his explanation of your
assignment "Well, the impossible seems to be happening to put it
shortly. We have detected an anomaly we are calling a spacetime rift,
it is expanding rapidly. We are projecting a critical point of
expansion that will have fatal results for this star system, sector
and potentially beyond. We don't know much about it, but we do have
the research team on Zuria and here working on it. The point is we
need your expertise to work with their expertise to get this controlled
and in the best case completely nullified. So that is just about it.
Any questions?"
