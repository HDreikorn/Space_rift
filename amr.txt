You reach the AMR building, it is a tall modern building with beautiful
landscaping around the outside. Flower gardens surround the whole campus.
You always find it fun and exciting to see the flora and fauna of a
different planet. You walk up to the door of the AMR lab and pull on the
door only to find that it is locked and there is no one at or around the
door to open up and let you in.
You remember to look through your bag and find. . .
