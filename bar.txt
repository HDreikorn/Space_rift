You wait no more than 15 minutes when a woman sits next to
you and seemingly relieved says "Good galaxy, I'm glad I
found you here. You are Dr. M Castellano correct?"

You nod and say sorry then ask what this is all about.

"Oh sorry, you are probably confused and weary about this
whole situation. My name is Vox I'm a part of the 
hacktivist network across the federation. I wanted to give
you information about what your current assignment director
aren't telling you, it could affect how you solve the
problem. Come over to my team's HQ and we can give you
proof. What do you say?"
