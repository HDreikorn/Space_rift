Vox says "Well, there is supposed to be a hidden thumbdrive
will information about closing the rift. You see, the rift was discovered
a while ago and was potentially a threat even then, but greed got in the
way. Arguments were had between some researchers who were not in favor of
the project and others that were more supportive of the government's
decisions to make gain off these hostile beings. Those not in favor came
up with a solution to close the rifts, so that our universe would not end
up collapsing due to rift laws. But when the others found out about this
they caused a chaotic riot on Oots, which was staged to look like it was
done by our organization. And everything was destroyed. Supposedly one of
those scientists had saved the information somewhere in the lab in hopes
that someone would find and use it to save our universe before too late."
