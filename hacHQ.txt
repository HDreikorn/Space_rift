Vox starts immeadiatly, "The government has basically caused the
rift by interaction with an highly classified rift beings. A
deal was struck and apparently broken on their end. So they are
trying to get you to fix the problem without learning about the
rift beings. You were specifically chosen for being new enough
to the department to not question what they are hiding, but smart
enough to come up with at least a temporary solution..."
You sit inside the unassuming office as you listen to Vox go on
about the information they've gathered showing you key files and
other data to prove her case. She finally stops her explanation
and you realize you must come to a decision about all this
information
