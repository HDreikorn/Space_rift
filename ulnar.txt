Ulnar's lush mediterranean landscape  fills your eyes with joy as you land
your shuttle. No matter how many planets you see this on, this is one of
the terrains that always feels special. As soon as you land to your north
you see the main government building, with its sleek metallic curves and
artfully designed architecture. To your south you see the road that leads
to the AMR lab. In the east there is a large fence and gate to control the
inflow for the facilities. You take note that you have left your shuttle
in the west parking area. HERB asks "Ok M, where to?""
