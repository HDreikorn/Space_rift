Vox goes on, "Long story short theres a info on oots that will
help you solve the problem...let me know if you want history
on that. In any case,
We have come up with the solution that HERB will hopefully be
on board with. We have devised a program and hardware devices
that can be installed into HERB that will go undetected. This
setup will work together to find the drive. You can then upload
the information on site, it will immediately be sent to us for
backup and you can also choose to store for yourself. I 
recommend looking at the contents to see what to do and where
you should being going to implement the solution."
